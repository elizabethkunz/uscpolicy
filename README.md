4. Policy Details 
As a private institution of higher education, USC reserves the right to restrict or prohibit access to university property; specific examples as follows:

Access to the University Park Campus (UPC) is restricted to students, faculty, staff, and registered guests between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. daily. Within a USC campus, certain buildings or locations may be restricted to certain individuals associated with the university or their guests.
USC may close the UPC campus perimeter or further restrict access to certain areas of the campus and/or campus buildings or other university property, with or without notice, in the event of an unusual occurrence or emergency that poses a threat to the safety of persons or property on the campus.
USC may prohibit access to the campus or specified university property by any individual who engages in conduct that violates university policies (e.g., the Violence-Free Campus and Workplace policy).
USC may establish special health-related requirements for access to the campus or specified buildings, or university-sponsored events or activities, to support the health and safety of the university community. These requirements may be equal to or exceed guidelines issued by public health authorities.
As described in the Political Activities Policy, the university, in exercising its responsibility to provide and maintain an atmosphere of free inquiry and expression, may establish reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions (when USC facilities are permitted to be used for political activities) for the purpose of avoiding disruption to or substantial interference with its regular and essential operations and activities.
USC reserves the right to prohibit certain activities on university property, specifically:

Unauthorized Food Vendors: food may not be sold or distributed by unauthorized vendors on university property (e.g., food carts pushed onto campus).
Unauthorized Merchandise Vendors: unauthorized merchandise may not be sold on university property at any time, including on campus during game days.
Unauthorized Product Sales: vendors may not buy books from students or sell other merchandise items on university property without university authorization.
Trash Scavenging: searching through university trash containers for recyclables or other items is prohibited. Individuals found searching trash containers will be asked to leave and will be subject to arrest for trespassing if they persist.
Anyone witnessing unauthorized activities should immediately notify DPS:
